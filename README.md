# Cranfield-LEO-PNT
Repository for Cranfield's ASE 2025-2026 LEO-PNT Group project. Aimed at designing a full post-process receiver chain demonstrator for precise Positioning, Navigation and Timing with (future) real-time capabilities. The initial focus is the development of the core software architecture that enables this functionality.

## Algorithm Structure
The system is structured around a processing algorithm composed of three main stages, each of which is critical to achieving high-accuracy PNT performance.

### 1. Acquistion
This initial part takes care of the signal post processed by Software-Designed Radio (SDR). By means of filters applications, a lower noise signal should be obtained. From there the programmer should be able to extract key (non-encrypted) information, such as time of transmission or relevant satellite information (e.g: ID, for later use to obtain TLEs). Alongside, the code shall be able to identify parts of the signal, highlighting the peaks of synchronisation, which are periodic peaks that are repeated every x milliseconds, which are essential for determining time delays caused by Doppler shifts.

### 2. Tracking
In this stage, the system accurately characterises and tracks the Doppler shift from a noisy signal input. Kalman filtering techniques are applied to smooth the data and enable reliable extrapolation of the satelliteâ€™s frequency variations over time.

### 3. Navigation
This final stage implements navigation algorithms derived from established literature. The results obtained here represent the ultimate goal of the project: determining the position of the receiver based on the processed and tracked satellite signal data from LEO.
